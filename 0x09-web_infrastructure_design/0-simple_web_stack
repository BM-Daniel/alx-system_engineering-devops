Description
This basic web infrastructure hosts a website called "www.foobar.com". The server that houses this site has various componenets included and they share the resources of the server such as CPU, RAM and Storage


Specifications of the Infrastructure
- What is a server
    A server is basically a computer that renders services to other computers (clients).

- What is the role of the domain name
    The domain name is an alias for an IP address of a site. This alias is in text format which is much friendly to humans. The alias for 8.8.8.8 in this project is www.foobar.com which is recorded in the DNS

- What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
    The DNS record for www.foobar.com is an AAA (IPv4) record. This can be found by typing 'dig www.foobar.com' into a terminal

- What is the role of the web server
    The web server receives HTTP / HTTPS requests from clients and then provides the info that is needed or sends back an error to the client.

- What is the role of the application server
    The app server houses applications that are provided to users. An example is the apps (Photoshop, Premiere Pro) that Adobe provides its users

- What is the role of the database
    The database keeps records of information that it is provided. It performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to the records

- What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
    The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) / Internet Protocol (IP) communication is used between client and server


Problems of the Infrastructure
- SPOF
    In this task, we are working with a single server which provides an SPOF. When there is an issue with the databse system, then no records can be retrieved.

- Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
    During maintenance, the server needs to be taken offline. This means that the web site becomes inaccessible to users.

- Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
    At moments that there is a significant increase in traffic, the site will slow down due to maximum usage of resources
